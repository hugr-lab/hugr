# HUGR

The DataMesh service that provides access to various data sources through common GraphQL API.

The Hugr is built on the top of [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) and uses it as an calculation engine. The Hugr can work with following data sources:

- PostgreSQL (incl. with extensions: PostGIS, TimescaleDB)
- DuckDB files
- HTTP REST API (support OpenAPI v3)
- All file formats and data sources that supported by DuckDB (CSV, Parquet, JSON, ESRI Shape, etc.)

Files can be stored in the local file system or in the cloud storage (currently support only s3 cloud storage, in plan: Azure, GCS, AWS, R2).

MySQL, SQLLite, Clickhouse will be supported in the future.

## Executable

The executable is built with Go and can be run on any platform that supports Go. The executable is built with the following command:

```bash
CG_ENABLED=1 go build -o hugr cmd/server/main.go
```

## Dependencies

The Hugr uses the [Hugr query engine package](https://github.com/hugr-lab/query-engine).

## Deployment

The common way to deploy the Hugr is to use Docker. The Docker image provided by repository [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/hugr-lab/docker). There are two images provided:

- ghcr.io/hugr-lab/server - simple hugr server,
- ghcr.io/hugr-lab/automigrate - simple hugr server with automigration for the core-db schema.

## Environment variables

### CORS

- CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS - comma separated list of allowed origins for CORS, default: "", example: ```"http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001"```
- CORS_ALLOWED_METHODS - comma separated list of allowed methods for CORS, default: "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS"

- AUTH_CONFIG_FILE - path to the file with authentication config, default: ""

The format of the config file is described in the [auth.md](auth.md) file. The config file can be in JSON or YAML format. The config file is used to configure authentication and authorization for the server.

### Cache

There are two types of cache: L1 and L2. L1 cache is in-memory cache (using [bigcache](https://github.com/allegro/bigcache)), L2 cache is external cache (Redis, Memcached, Pegasus). The L1 cache is used for the most frequently used data, while the L2 cache is used for less frequently used data.

- CACHE_TTL - time to live for cache, default: 0
- CACHE_L1_ENABLED - enabled L1 cache, default: false
- CACHE_L1_MAX_SIZE - memory limit for L1 cache in MB
- CACHE_L1_CLEAN_TIME - memory cleaning interval
- CACHE_L1_EVICTION_TIME - eviction from the L1 cache interval
- CACHE_L1_MAX_ITEM_SIZE - max size of the item in L1 cache
- CACHE_L1_SHARDS - number of shards in L1 cache
- CACHE_L2_ENABLED - enabled L2 cache, default: false
- CACHE_L2_BACKEND - L2 cache backend, can be "redis", "memcached" or "pegasus"
- CACHE_L2_ADDRESSES - addresses of L2 cache servers, comma separated list, default: ""
- CACHE_L2_DATABASE - database name for L2 cache (use for redis only)
- CACHE_L2_USERNAME - username for L2 cache (use for redis only)
- CACHE_L2_PASSWORD - password for L2 cache (use for redis only)

## CoreDB migrations

For some reason it can be needed to run migrations for the core db. It makes manually by the special tool - migrate that provided in this repository (cmd/migrate). The following command run migrations:

```bash
CG_ENABLED=1 go build -o migrate cmd/migrate/main.go

./migrate -path /migrations -core-db core-db.duckdb
```
